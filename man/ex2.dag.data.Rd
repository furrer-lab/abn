\format{
A data frame, binary variables are factors.
The relevant formulas are given below (note these do not give parameter
estimates just the form of the relationships, e.g. logit()=1
means a logit link function and comprises of only an intercept term).
\itemize{
\item{b1}{binary,logit()=1+g1+b2+b3+p3+b4+g4+b5}
\item{g1}{gaussian,identity()=1}
\item{p1}{poisson,log()=1+g6}
\item{b2}{binary,logit()=1+p3+b4+p6}
\item{g2}{gaussian,identify()=1+b2}
\item{p2}{poisson,log()=1+b2}

\description{
10000 observations simulated from a DAG with 18 variables three sets each from Poisson, Bernoulli and Gaussian distributions.

## The true underlying stochastic model has DAG - this data is a single realisation.
