\usage{
export_abnFit_mle_nodes(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class abnFit fitted with method = "mle"}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
A named list where each element represents a node in the network.
Each node is identified by its node ID and contains the following components:
\item{nodeid}{A list representing a single node with components:}
\item{label}{Character string. The display name/label of the node.}
\item{distribution}{Character string. The statistical distribution type
(e.g., "gaussian", "binomial", "poisson", "multinomial").}
\item{df}{A named vector of degrees of freedom for the node's model parameters, if available.}
\item{mse}{Mean Squared Error of the node's model, if available.}
\item{sse}{Sum of Squared Errors of the node's model, if available.}
\item{parameterisation}{A named list containing the estimated parameters
for this node. The structure depends on the distribution type and fitting method:
\itemize{
\item For Gaussian nodes: \code{intercept}, \code{coefficients}, \code{stderr}
\item For Binomial/Poisson nodes: \code{intercept}, \code{coefficients}, \code{stderr}
\item For Multinomial nodes: category-specific parameter lists with \code{stderr}
}}

\description{
Export node information from abnFit objects fitted with MLE (non-mixed effects)
}
\details{
This function extracts node parameterisation information from abnFit objects
that were fitted using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach without
mixed-effects (i.e., no group.var specified). The function processes the coefficients
and standard errors stored in the abnFit object.

The \code{coef} component contains the estimated regression coefficients for each node,
stored as a matrix where column names indicate the parameter names (e.g., "g2",
"m11", "b1|intercept"). These represent the linear model coefficients from the
generalized linear model fitted to each node given its parents in the DAG.

The \code{Stderror} component contains the corresponding standard errors for each
coefficient, providing a measure of uncertainty in the parameter estimates. The
structure mirrors that of the \code{coef} component.

For different distribution types:
\itemize{
\item Gaussian nodes: Include intercept and slope coefficients
\item Binomial/Poisson nodes: Include intercept and slope coefficients on logit/log scale
\item Multinomial nodes: Include category-specific intercepts (reference level omitted)
and coefficients, following standard multinomial logistic regression conventions
