\description{
\code{abn} is a collection of functions for fitting, selecting/learning, analyzing, reporting Additive Bayesian Networks.
}
\section{General overview}{

What is \pkg{abn}:
Bayesian network modeling is a data analysis technique that is ideally suited to messy, highly correlated, and complex data sets.
This methodology is somewhat distinct from other forms of statistical modeling in that its focus is on structure discovery - determining an optimal graphical model that describes the inter-relationships in the underlying processes which generated the data.
It is a multivariate technique and can be used for one or many dependent variables.
This is a data-driven approach, as opposed to, rely only on subjective expert opinion to determine how variables of interest are inter-related (for example, structural equation modeling).

The R package \pkg{abn} is designed to fit additive Bayesian models to observational data sets.
It contains routines to score Bayesian Networks based on Bayesian or information-theoretic formulation of generalized linear models.
It is equipped with exact search and greedy search algorithms to select the best network.
The Bayesian implementation supports random effects to control for one layer clustering.
It supports a possible mixture of continuous, discrete, and count data and inputs of prior knowledge at a structural level.

The R package \pkg{abn} requires the R package \pkg{Rgraphviz} to work well.
It is store outside of CRAN; see \sQuote{Examples} for the code to install the last version.

The web page \href{https://r-bayesian-networks.org/}{r-bayesian-networks.org} provides further case studies.
