\usage{
export_to_json(export_list, format, file = NULL, pretty = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{export_list}{The list to convert to JSON. Must contain graph, nodes, and arcs components, see details.}

\item{format}{The export format, currently only "json" is supported.}

\item{file}{Optional file path to save JSON. If NULL, returns JSON string}

\item{pretty}{Logical, whether to format JSON nicely}

Helper function to convert export list to JSON
}
\details{
The export_list must be a named list with the following components:
\itemize{
\item graph: A named list with metadata about the graph (e.g., method, n_nodes, n_observations, groupVar)
\item nodes: A named list where each element represents a node with its parameters and distribution. Each node should have:
\itemize{
\item label: Character string. The display name/label of the node.
\item distribution: Character string. The statistical distribution type (e.g., "gaussian", "binomial", "poisson", "multinomial").
\item parameterisation: A named list containing the estimated parameters for this node. The structure depends on the distribution type and fitting method.
}
\item arcs: A named list with arc details, including:
\itemize{
\item source: Character vector of source node IDs.
\item target: Character vector of target node IDs.
\item frequency: Numeric vector of arc frequencies (if available).
\item significance: Numeric vector of arc significance values (if available).
\item constraint: Character vector indicating if the arc was constrained (if available).
