## abn 3.0.7

2024-03-27 Matteo Delucchi

  * Reduced package size by compressions.
  * Speed up the checks on CRAN by reducing the number of examples to be run.
  * Fixed the checks on CRAN by resetting user options within functions and examples.
  * Fixed failing tests on CRAN due to the use of `INLA` package.
  * Reduced the number of empty tests by gracefully handling the specific conditions.
  * Improved documentation, fixed typos and added return values for each function.
  * Added Jonas Liechti as a contributor.

## abn 3.0.6

2024-03-21 Matteo Delucchi

  * New website
  * added JOSS paper
  * Changed `ChangeLog` into `NEWS.md`
  * Revised CITATION file
  * Updated README
  * added logo
  * Revised class names and methods
  * Added functional test for `getmarginals()`
  * Check for validity and sensibility of the `compute.fixed` argument.
  * Check for validity and sensibility of the `check` argument in `buildscoreCache()`.
  * Check codecoverage
  * harmonised plotting across different classes
  * Created new vignettes
  * relaxed tests to allow for complete and partial scientific notation in string outputs from BUGS files.
  * avoid examples and tests on CRAN that require INLA
  * Restructured the private developement repository to have only one public repo.

## abn 3.0.5

2024-01-18 Matteo Delucchi

  * Parallelization of `buildScoreCache(method='bayes')` and `fitAbn(method='bayes')` with `foreach()`.
  * Controlling the number of cores used by INLA. Before it was always using all available cores.
  * Specifying the type of parallelisation in `build.control()` and `fit.control()`.
  * Fixed bug in test of `simulateAbn()` that was failing on CRAN.
  * Increase package availability by skipping tests on CRAN that require INLA. This also speeds up the CRAN checks.

## abn 3.0.4

2023-11-03 Matteo Delucchi

  * Fixed format issues in source code that caused significant warnings with GCC and clang.
  * Temporary workaround to install the correct versions of INLA dependencies. This will be hopefully fixed in the next release of INLA.

2023-11-03 Matteo Delucchi

  * Temporarily fixed tests on CRAN Fedora flavour.

## abn 3.0.2

2023-10-23 Matteo Delucchi

## abn 3.0.0

2023-09-01 Matteo Delucchi

  * Implemented random-intercept model for `method="mle"` with argument `group.var`.
  * simulateAbn(): Fixed to run with all arguments. Enhancement: Simulates a hierarchical model if `group.var` is provided.
  * Fixed parallel computing for `method="mle"` that did not always run smoothly.
  * Beware, the structure of some objects has changed!
  * Updated documentation to Roxygen.
  * Rigorous checking of function arguments.
  * Upgraded unit test for testthat e3.
  * Implemented extensive unit tests and CI/CD pipelines.
  * Many (!) bugs fixed that mainly flew under the radar.
  * Removed deprecated functions.
  * Refactoring here and there. Especially to harmonise `buildScoreCache()` and `fitAbn()` for both methods "mle" and "bayes".

## abn 2.7-0

2022-04-02 Reinhard Furrer

  * plotAbn(): new arguments, now fully based on class `graphAM`, proper handling of lty, lwd etc.
  * options of `fitAbn()` and `buildScoreCache()` are now handled with a list passed to argument `control=`. Some of the default values have been slightly adapted.
  * Default list available via `fit.control()` and `build.control()`, including more options!
  * Significantly improved help of several functions and examples.
  * Improved display of print methods.
  * Possiblity to use single threaded with `for()` loop and with `foreach()`.
  * Due to proper method handling, the arguments `create.graph` in `searchHillClimber()` and `fitAbn(method="bayes")` has been removed.
  * Argument `verbose` properly implemented (including passing to JAGS functions).
  * New function `compareEG()` to compare two essential graphs.
  * Additional argument checking an cleaning of many error messages.


  ### Internal changes:

  * Option `error.verbose` properly propagated to C functions.
	* New option `trace` passed to "lbfgsb".
	* Less ARMA messages, using now `#define ARMA_WARN_LEVEL 1`.
	* Some GSL error now caught at R level.
	* Severe R and moderate C code cleaning.
