Potential applications include computer-assisted hypothesis testing, automated scientific discovery, and automated construction of probabilistic expert systems. We extend the basic method to handle missing data and hidden (latent) variables. We show how to perform probabilistic inference by averaging over the inferences of multiple belief networks. Results are presented of a preliminary evaluation of an algorithm for constructing a belief network from a database of cases. Finally, we relate the methods in this paper to previous work, and we discuss open problems.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years there has been significant progress in algorithms and methods for inducing Bayesian networks from data. However, in complex data analysis problems, we need to go beyond being satisfied with inducing networks with high scores. We need to provide confidence measures on features of these networks: Is the existence of an edge between two nodes warranted? Is the Markov blanket of a given node robust? Can we say something about the ordering of the variables? We should be able to address these questions, even when the amount of data is not enough to induce a high scoring network. In this paper we propose Efron's Bootstrap as a computationally efficient approach far answering these questions. In addition, we propose to use these confidence measures to induce better structures from the data, and to detect the presence of latent variables.},

  Abstract                 = {In many multivariate domains, we are interested in analyzing the dependency structure of the underlying distribution, e.g., whether two variables are in direct interaction. We can represent dependency structures using Bayesian network models. To analyze a given data set, Bayesian model selection attempts to find the most likely (MAP) model, and uses its structure to answer these questions. However, when the amount of available data is modest, there might be many models that have non-negligible posterior. Thus, we want compute the Bayesian posterior of a feature, i.e., the total posterior probability of all models that contain it. In this paper, we propose a new approach for this task. We first show how to efficiently compute a sum over the exponential number of networks that are consistent with a fixed order over network variables. This allows us to compute, for a given order, both the marginal probability of the data and the posterior of a feature. We then use this result as the basis for an algorithm that approximates the Bayesian posterior of a feature. Our approach uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, but over orders rather than over network structures. The space of orders is smaller and more regular than the space of structures, and has much a smoother posterior "landscape". We present empirical results on synthetic and real-life datasets that compare our approach to full model averaging (when possible), to MCMC over network structures, and to a non-Bayesian bootstrap approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Learning a Bayesian network structure from data is a well-motivated but computationally hard task. We present an algorithm that computes the exact posterior probability of a subnetwork, e. g., a directed edge; a modified version of the algorithm finds one of the most probable network structures. This algorithm runs in time O(n2(n) + n(k+1)C(m)), where n is the number of network variables, k is a constant maximum in-degree, and C(m) is the cost of computing a single local marginal conditional likelihood for m data instances. This is the first algorithm with less than super-exponential complexity with respect to n. Exact computation allows us to tackle complex cases where existing Monte Carlo methods and local search procedures potentially fail. We show that also in domains with a large number of variables, exact computation is feasible, given suitable a priori restrictions on the structures; combining exact and inexact methods is also possible. We demonstrate the applicability of the presented algorithm on four synthetic data sets with 17, 22, 37, and 100 variables.},
