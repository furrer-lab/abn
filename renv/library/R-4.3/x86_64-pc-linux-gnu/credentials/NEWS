2.0.1
  - Precompute vignette due to credential issues on some CRAN machines.

2.0.0
  - ssh_key_info() now returns ECDSA instead of RSA key by default if both exist.
    If you get authentication problems with 'gert' you probably need to upload your
    ecdsa key to your host (e.g. using ssh_setup_github()) or otherwise delete the
    ECDSA key from ~/.ssh/ecdsa to go back and use your old RSA key.
  - ssh_keygen() now defaults to generating ECDSA (P-521) keys

1.3.2
  - Disable example in vignette that would prompt for user input on Windows

1.3.1
  - Set permission to user-read only for generated private keys

1.3.0
  - PATs stored with set_github_pat() are now stored under username 'PersonalAccessToken'
    to match the new Git Credential Manager Core behavior. You may have to re-enter your PAT.
  - Small UX improvements.

1.2.1
  - Quote path to $GIT_ASKTOKEN, for example when credentials is installed in "Program Files"
  - Fix for set_github_pat() token prompt in R.app on MacOS

1.2.0
  - Bug fixes and tweaks for set_github_pat(): gains parameters to disable validation

1.1
  - Fix for vignette when no 'git' is installed
  - Fix for vignette when credential helper requires user interaction (CRAN MAC)
