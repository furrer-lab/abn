	abstract = {Bayesian network ({BN}) modeling is a rich and flexible analytical framework capable of elucidating complex veterinary epidemiological data. It is a graphical modeling technique that enables visual presentation of multi-dimensional results while retaining statistical rigor in population-level inference. Using previously published case study data about feline calicivirus ({FCV}) and other respiratory pathogens in cats in Switzerland, a full {BN} modeling analysis is presented. The analysis shows that reducing the group size and vaccinating animals are the two actionable factors directly associated with the {FCV} status and are primary targets to control for {FCV} infection. The presence of gingivostomatitis and {\textbackslash}emph\{Mycoplasma felis\} are also associated with {FCV} status, but signs of upper respiratory tract disease ({URTD}) are not. {FCV} data is particularly well-suited to a network modeling approach as both multiple pathogens and multiple clinical signs per pathogen are involved, along with multiple potentially interrelated risk factors. {BN} modeling is a holistic approach - all variables of interest may be mutually interdependent - which may help to address issues such as confounding and collinear factors, as well as disentangle directly versus indirectly related variables. We introduce the {BN} methodology, as an alternative to the classical uni- and multivariable regression approaches commonly used for risk factor analyses. We advice and guide researchers about how to use {BNs} as an exploratory data tool and demonstrate limitations and practical issues. We present a step-by-step case study using {FCV} data along with all code necessary to reproduce our analyses using the open source R environment. We compare and contrast the findings of the current case study using {BN} modeling with previous results which used classical regression techniques, and we highlight new potential insights. Finally, we discuss advanced methods such as Bayesian model averaging, a common way of accounting for model uncertainty in a Bayesian network context.},

	abstract = {Bayesian network modelling is a well adapted approach to study messy and highly correlated datasets which are very common in, e.g., systems epidemiology. A popular approach to learn a Bayesian network from an observational datasets is to identify the maximum a posteriori network in a search-and-score approach. Many scores have been proposed both Bayesian or frequentist based. In an applied perspective, a suitable approach would allow multiple distributions for the data and is robust enough to run autonomously. A promising framework to compute scores are generalized linear models. Indeed, there exists fast algorithms for estimation and many tailored solutions to common epidemiological issues. The purpose of this paper is to present an R package abn that has an implementation of multiple frequentist scores and some realistic simulations that show its usability and performance. It includes features to deal efficiently with data separation and adjustment which are very common in systems epidemiology.},

	abstract = {Background
Additive Bayesian Network ({ABN}) is a graphical model which extends Generalized Linear Modelling ({GLM}) to multiple dependent variables. The present study compares results from {GLM} with those from {ABN} analysis used to identify factors associated with Leptospira interrogans sv Pomona (Pomona) infection by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of these two methodologies, to corroborate inferences informing health and safety measures at abattoirs in New Zealand ({NZ}).
Methodology and findings
In a cohort study in four sheep slaughtering abattoirs in {NZ}, sera were collected twice a year from 384 meat workers and tested by Microscopic Agglutination with a 91\% sensitivity and 94\% specificity for Pomona. The study primarily addressed the effect of work position, personal protective equipment ({PPE}) and non-work related exposures such as hunting on a new infection with Pomona. Significantly associated with Pomona were “Work position” and two “Abattoirs” ({GLM}), and “Work position” ({ABN}). The odds of Pomona infection ({OR}, [95\% {CI}]) was highest at stunning and hide removal ({ABN} 41.0, [6.9–1044.2]; {GLM} 57.0, [6.9–473.3]), followed by removal of intestines, bladder, and kidneys ({ABN} 30.7, [4.9–788.4]; {GLM} 33.8, [4.2–271.1]). Wearing a facemask, glasses or gloves ({PPE}) did not result as a protective factor in {GLM} or {ABN}.
Conclusions/Significance
The odds of Pomona infection was highest at stunning and hide removal. {PPE} did not show any indication of being protective in {GLM} or {ABN}. In {ABN} all relationships between variables are modelled; hence it has an advantage over {GLM} due to its capacity to capture the natural complexity of data more effectively.},

	abstract = {Background
Multi-drug resistant bacteria are seen increasingly and there are gaps in our understanding of the complexity of antimicrobial resistance, partially due to a lack of appropriate statistical tools. This hampers efficient treatment, precludes determining appropriate intervention points and renders prevention very difficult.

Methods
We re-analysed data from a previous study using additive Bayesian networks. The data contained information on resistances against seven antimicrobials and seven potential risk factors from 86 non-typhoidal Salmonella isolates from laying hens in 46 farms in Uganda.

Results
The final graph contained 22 links between risk factors and antimicrobial resistances. Solely ampicillin resistance was linked to the vaccinating person and disposal of dead birds. Systematic associations between ampicillin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and chloramphenicol, which was also linked to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim were detected. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was also directly linked to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim. Trimethoprim was linked to sulfonamide and ciprofloxacin, which was also linked to sulfonamide. Tetracycline was solely linked to ciprofloxacin.

Conclusions
Although the results needs to be interpreted with caution due to a small data set, additive Bayesian network analysis allowed a description of a number of associations between the risk factors and antimicrobial resistances investigated.},

	abstract = {Clinical decision making regarding the treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms ({IA}) benefits from a better understanding of the interplay of {IA} rupture risk factors. Probabilistic graphical models can capture and graphically display potentially causal relationships in a mechanistic model. In this study, Bayesian networks ({BN}) were used to estimate {IA} rupture risk factors influences. From 1248 {IA} patient records, a retrospective, single-cohort, patient-level data set with 9 phenotypic rupture risk factors (n=790 complete entries) was extracted. Prior knowledge together with score-based structure learning algorithms estimated rupture risk factor interactions. Two approaches, discrete and mixed-data additive {BN}, were implemented and compared. The corresponding graphs were learned using non-parametric bootstrapping and Markov chain Monte Carlo, respectively. The {BN} models were compared to standard descriptive and regression analysis methods. Correlation and regression analyses showed significant associations between {IA} rupture status and patient’s sex, familial history of {IA}, age at {IA} diagnosis, {IA} location, {IA} size and {IA} multiplicity. {BN} models confirmed the findings from standard analysis methods. More precisely, they directly associated {IA} rupture with familial history of {IA}, {IA} size and {IA} location in a discrete framework. Additive model formulation, enabling mixed-data, found that {IA} rupture was directly influenced by patient age at diagnosis besides additional mutual influences of the risk factors. This study establishes a data-driven methodology for mechanistic disease modelling of {IA} rupture and shows the potential to direct clinical decision-making in {IA} treatment, allowing personalised prediction.},

This is especially true in real-world areas where we seek to answer complex questions based on hypothetical evidence to determine actions for intervention. However, determining the graphical structure of a {BN} remains a major challenge, especially when modelling a problem under causal assumptions. Solutions to this problem include the automated discovery of {BN} graphs from data, constructing them based on expert knowledge, or a combination of the two. This paper provides a comprehensive review of combinatoric algorithms proposed for learning {BN} structure from data, describing 74 algorithms including prototypical, well-established and state-of-the-art approaches. The basic approach of each algorithm is described in consistent terms, and the similarities and differences between them highlighted. Methods of evaluating algorithms and their comparative performance are discussed including the consistency of claims made in the literature. Approaches for dealing with data noise in real-world datasets and incorporating expert knowledge into the learning process are also covered.},
